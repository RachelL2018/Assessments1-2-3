#Pyton Assessments week 1-6

#File 1: week 1 problem set fib.py
this is the solution for the Fibonacci Sequence. This is where the  number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. For this assessment the nth Fibonacci number where n is the sum of the first and last letters of my name Rachel where R is 18 and L is 12 totalling 30 so n 30

#File 2: week 2 problem set fib2.py
this is the solution for the Fibonacci Sequence. For this assessment the programme was changed to a string varaible and the surname was input and the nth Fibonacci number was calulated where the suname Leonard was input where L is 12 and D is 4 totalling 16.

#File 3: week 3 problem set Collatz.py 
This is the solution for the Collatz conjecture. The Collatz conjectur is a conjecture in mathematics.The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.It starts with any positive integer n. It is where each value is obtained from the previous value and if the previous value is even, the next value is one half the previous value. Otherwise, the next value is 3 times the previous vlaue plus 1.

#File 4: week 4 problem set euler5.py
This is the solution for the Euler problem 5. This is where the smallest positive number evenly divisable  by all numbers 1 to 20 is found.

#File 5:week 5 problem set week5.py
This is the solution for the Iris data where the data from the Iris file is read in and printed in a nice format.

#File 6: week 6 problem set wk6.py
This is the solution for the Factorial. This is where a function has to be used to find the factorial of a number. The factorial of a number is that number multiplied bu all the positive numbers less than it.
